# Serenite Server

#### Welcome to the server for all projects that will fall under the Serenite umbrella.

## Current Planned Sites:

### 1. Reminders

-   A dedicated site to manage reminders.
-   Set up group reminders.

### 2. Finances

-   Explore and visualize financial details.
-   Share finances with others. Those finances will be included individually, and can be updated by every associated user.

### 3. Guides

-   Create guides of how to do a certain task. This will be specialized for whatever guide needed, for example, a recipe guide.
-   Can be grouped together into a guidebook.
-   Can be shared and edited by permitted users.

### 4. Calendar

-   Calendar, finances, reminders, and more.
-   This is individual.
-   May just put this in the hub instead.

### 5. Notebook

-   Notebook, write markdown notes

### 6. Hub

-   Be able to quickly search for anything in Serenite.
-   For example, a search such as, `Show me notes about Computer Science that I have between 12/24/23 and January 2 2023` would return a list of notes relating to Computer Science from your Serenite Notebook.

## Other plans:

### Third-party support

-   I am attempting to create this in mind for other projects as well. I want other projects to be able to easily incorporate all of Serenite. Most of this server should be able to be accessed by others. An example is I am creating the login system to be able to easily drop into other projects.
